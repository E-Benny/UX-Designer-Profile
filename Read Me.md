## UX Designer Profile Card

This HTML file displays a customized profile of a UX Designer using glowing texts, interactive buttons and stylized font.

## Installation

This HTML file does not need Yarn or NPM to install the application. Just open the HTML file to use it.

## Project Status

The project runs as expected. I did not implement any JavaScript or PHP code, thus any information entered into the radio buttons will not trigger a function or event.

## Design Execution

I designed this profile by using a lot of techniques in CSS. I copied the image address of the profile picture through Pinterest and centered it in the profile card. Next, I made use of the glowing texts by giving it a customized text-shadow.
